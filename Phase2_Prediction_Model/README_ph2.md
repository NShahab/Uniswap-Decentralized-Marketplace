# Work Report: Financial Time Series Prediction with LSTM and GRU Models

**Prepared by [Nahid Shahab] on [2025-01-28]**

## 1. Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict financial time series data using advanced deep learning techniques. The focus is on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. The project specifically deals with cryptocurrency price prediction, using historical data to forecast future trends. Python, TensorFlow, and related libraries were employed to implement the models.

---

## 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Data Loading
- The historical cryptocurrency price data was loaded from a CSV file using Pandas.
- Relevant columns (`open_time`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`) were extracted.

### 2.2 Data Transformation
- The `open_time` column was converted to datetime format and set as the index for better time series handling.
- Data was resampled to different timeframes (e.g., hourly, 4-hourly, daily) to accommodate different analysis resolutions.

### 2.3 Feature Engineering
- Technical indicators were added to enrich the feature set:
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Calculated using a rolling window.
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Computed to capture momentum in the price movements.
  - **Bollinger Bands:** Added to indicate price volatility.

---

## 3. Data Normalization and Sequence Creation

### 3.1 Normalization
- All features were normalized using `MinMaxScaler` from the `sklearn` library to scale values between 0 and 1, ensuring stable model training.

### 3.2 Sequence Creation
- Historical sequences of 50 time steps were created to train the models.
- A sliding window approach was used to form input-output pairs where each sequence corresponds to the next time step's prediction.

---

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1 LSTM Model
- **Layers:**
  - Two LSTM layers with 64 units each and ReLU activation.
  - Dropout layers (rate = 0.2) to mitigate overfitting.
  - Dense layers for final predictions.
- The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

### 4.2 GRU Model
- **Layers:**
  - Two GRU layers with 64 units each and ReLU activation.
  - Dropout layers (rate = 0.2).
  - Dense layers for output generation.
- Similar compilation settings as the LSTM model.

---

## 5. Model Training and Evaluation

### 5.1 Training Process
- Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Models were trained using Early Stopping to monitor validation loss and halt training when no improvement was observed.
- Batch size and epochs were tuned for optimal performance.

### 5.2 Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated on the testing set using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Square root of MSE for interpretability.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values.
- **R-squared (R²):** Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
